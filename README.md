# SVG Image Maker

This is a command-line application that generates SVG logos based on user input. The application allows you to specify text, text color, shape, and shape color to create a custom SVG logo.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/svg-logo-generator.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   cd svg-logo-generator

3. Install the required dependecies:

   npm install

4. Run the application:

   npm start

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter text, text color, shape, and shape color. The application will generate an SVG logo named 'logo.svg' in the project directory.

## Running Tests
To run the included tests, use the following command:

'npm test'

This will execute test cases for the shape classes (Square, Triangle, and Circle) to ensure they work correctly.

## Example

Here's an example of how to generate an SVG logo using the application:

1.Enter up to three characters: ABC
2.Enter text color (color keyword or hexadecimal number): blue
3.Choose a shape: square
4.Enter shape color (color keyword or hexadecimal number): red
The application will create an SVG logo with the text "ABC" inside a red square with a blue text color.
